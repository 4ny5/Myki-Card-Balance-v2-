# Myki Card Balance [v2] 

**Only Works with Iphones :)**

Working with [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?ign-mpt=uo%3D4), Widgets iOS App.

## How to add 'Myki Card Balannce' Widget to iOS?

1) Download [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?ign-mpt=uo%3D4) From the App Store.

2) Add a new script on scriptable, copy everything in "MykiCard_Balance.js"

3) You're almost there, if you see an error while trying to run the code? don't worry.

4) Go to your Widgets library and find Scriptable, make sure to pick the long Rectangle widget. ("Disclaimer It's not supported for the other widgets aka the [Small or Large Widget.]")

5) press hold onto the widget, and press 'Edit Widget' and choose select 'Script' and tap it, then choose the 'MykiCard_Balance' Script. 
Once you're done change 'When Interacting' to Run Script, set Parameter to your myki 'Card Number' located at the back of your myki.

**Ps while Entering your 'Card Number' for your myki dont add any spaces.**

**Running low on Credit? once your widget is done there will be a section called 'Top Up' and it'll redirect you to the 
offical Myki website to 'Top up your myki'. **
